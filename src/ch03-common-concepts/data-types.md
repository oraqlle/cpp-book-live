# Data Types

As we mentioned on the last page, C++ is a *statically typed* language which means the
type of data must be known (or deducable) to the compiler. C++ has a large selection of
types available to use, some are language primitives and others are defined in the
standard library. In this page we will look at four categories of types,
*scalar integrals*, *floating point*, *compound* and special types.
